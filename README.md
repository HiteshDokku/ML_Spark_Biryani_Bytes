# ML Spark - Kaggle Competition (Tvastr x Innodatatics)

This repository contains our solution for the **ML SPARK competition**, a Data Analytics & Machine Learning challenge organized by **Tvastr** in collaboration with **Innodatatics**.

---

## ðŸ§  Problem Overview

The ML SPARK competition focuses on developing a **data-driven framework** to optimize customer engagement and improve marketing conversion rates for financial institutions.

In the competitive financial sector, traditional marketing efforts often yield low conversions due to poor targeting. Machine Learning offers an opportunity to improve these efforts by identifying which customers are more likely to respond to marketing campaigns.

## ðŸ“Š Domain Description

### Objective:
Build a predictive framework that analyzes customer behavior (demographics, financial history, and past campaign responses) and predicts the **likelihood of engagement**.

### Key Goals:
- Segment customers efficiently
- Enhance marketing precision
- Predict subscription behavior

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Requirements

### ðŸ”Ž Analytical Framework
- Explore customer demographics, financial background, and behavioral patterns
- Identify critical decision factors like income, loan history, communication preferences, and timing

### ðŸ¤– Machine Learning
- Data preprocessing: missing value handling, feature engineering, transformations
- Model building: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods, or Deep Learning
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC
- Feature importance insights

### ðŸ“š Case Study Implementation
- Use real-world-like data to simulate marketing outcomes
- Identify customer segments likely to respond
- Provide visualizations and actionable insights

## ðŸ“Œ Note

The dataset used contains **class imbalance**, especially in predicting subscription. Techniques such as **oversampling (e.g., SMOTE/ADASYN)** were applied to improve model generalization.

Visualizations and insights from both unsupervised and supervised learning are presented to guide marketing efforts effectively.

## ðŸ“ˆ Outcome

Our models aim to provide financial institutions with tools to:
- Increase engagement rates
- Reduce campaign costs
- Understand key drivers behind customer decisions
